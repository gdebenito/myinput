# Input application

## Purpose

I need a tool to dump my **TODO** thoughts in a fast and simple way.

This Input Application launches a gtk frame with a input box.

The text you input, is redirected to a file you assign.

This way I can stack all my todos in a **Inbox** file and check later!


## Workflow

1. Add tasks/todos with myinput application
2. Focus -> Finish what I'm doing
3. Organize todos/ calendar schedule / archive

## Launch application

```
./main.py
```
